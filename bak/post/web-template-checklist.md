Web Template Checklist
===

It seems that nowadays we keep coming back to themeforest.net and the likes for more template and UI to be used in our project.

As such, it seems quite inconsistent to not have something solid as reference while making the decision for which themes are the best.

So, hey me in the future: use these pointers as your starting point!

My templates should have:

- Bootstrap 4
- Clear grid (header, sidebar and footer)
- Jquery supported
- Easy to change main colors in css, var() should do the trick
- Something along the line of toshout

My template is nice if:

- Have some charts
- Datatable.js integration
- Angular'ized'
- Vue'ized'
