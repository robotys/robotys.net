MVP Most Important Lesson
===

![The Reality Of MVP](/media/mvp-important-lesson.png)

... Is that it is not about creating something.

It is not about your product.

It is ultimately about your market. Or to be more specific: Market Feedback.

The result of an MVP is not a product, but a lesson.

Said lesson was derived from feedback.

Thus, make MVP to learn from feedback.

Not to fulfill your scope. Or features. Or 'This Sure Gonna Sells' idea.

MVP is nothing without feedback.

Feedback is nothing if you cannot learn from it.
